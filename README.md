## üßê About

MLProjectKN is a cutting-edge machine learning project designed to analyze student performance data and predict math scores using advanced algorithms. With MLProjectKN, we're paving the way for smarter education analytics and personalized learning experiences.

## üìÇ Project Structure
### About

- **artifacts**: Contains saved models, preprocessed data, and other artifacts generated during the project.
- **catboost_info**: Information generated by the CatBoost library during training.
- **logs**: Log files for tracking the project's execution and debugging.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **data**: Raw data used in the project.

### Source Code

- **src**: Source code directory containing the project's main components and utilities.
  - **components**: Modules for data ingestion, transformation, model training, and evaluation.
    - `data_ingestion.py`: Module for loading and preprocessing data.
    - `data_transformation.py`: Module for feature engineering and data preprocessing.
    - `model_trainer.py`: Module for training machine learning models.
  - `exception.py`: Custom exception classes for error handling.
  - `logger.py`: Logging configuration for the project.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions used across the project.

### Setup

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project. Install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MLProjectKN.git

## If someone wants to use my project, follow these steps:

#### Prepare your data: Ensure your data is in the correct format and structure for ingestion.

#### Data ingestion: Use the data_ingestion.py script to ingest your data into the project.

#### Data preprocessing: Execute the data_transformation.py script to preprocess the ingested data.

#### Model training: Run the model_trainer.py script to train machine learning models on the preprocessed data.

#### Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using the utils.py script.

#### You can further deploy it as well.
